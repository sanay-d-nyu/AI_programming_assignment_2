# bindings[i] == 1 if atom i is bound to True
#               -1 if atom i is bound to False
#                0 if atom i is unbound

# to split on and the first sign to try with it, as follows:
# 1) Let maxL be the length of the shortest clause in clauses.
#    E.g. if clauses contains clauses of length 2, 3, and 4, then maxL = 2.
# 2) Find the literal lit that occurs most often in clauses of length maxL
#     (which have been collected in the list longestClauses).
#    E.g. if maxL = 2, and literal 2 occurs in 3 clauses of length 2,
#          literal -3 occurs in 5, and literal -4 occurs in 1
#    then lit = -3
#    Return the atom and sign of lit, in this case 3 and -1
#    Note that if atom p occurs with sign s in k different clauses and maxL=2
#    then setting p to be s creates k different singleton clauses, which are all
